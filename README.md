# CoPE-ViT-Enhancement
This project implements a novel contextual position embedding technique (CoPE) in Vision Transformers (ViT) to improve their performance. The repository contains the implementation, training scripts, and evaluation metrics.



## Overview

Traditional Vision Transformers use fixed position embeddings to retain spatial information. This project replaces the fixed position embeddings with a novel contextual position embedding technique (CoPE) that adapts based on the input data. The CoPE method is inspired by recent advancements in position encoding for large language models.

## Key Features

- Implementation of CoPE in ViT architecture.
- Comparative analysis of traditional position embeddings versus CoPE.
- Scripts for training and evaluating the model on various datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CoPE-ViT-Enhancement.git
cd CoPE-ViT-Enhancement

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Training

To train the model with CoPE:

python train.py --config configs/cope_vit.yaml

Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model:

python evaluate.py --model_path checkpoints/cope_vit.pth --data_path data/test

Results

	•	Detailed performance metrics comparing traditional position embeddings and CoPE.
	•	Visualizations of attention maps showing the impact of CoPE.
